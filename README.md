# STXNext JS recruitment task

Welcome to STXNext JS recruitment task. 

This task was developed in order to test basic skillset of JS developer. Remember that looking for information
is a part of these skills!

* First, clone this repo and install backend dependencies.
* You can run backend service by typing `npm start`.
* Frontend for this task is in `index.html` file.
* Your mission is as follows:
    * It seems, that requests in our backend are failing miserably 30% of the times. It is by design.
    Something has to be done with this issue.
    * Backend returns stocks history for last 10 days. You need to download all symbols we support and then download
    history for every symbol separately. We highly encourage you to use fetch API.
    * Frontend consists of spinner and canvas. Make it spin while you are waiting for data. After that hide spinner
    and show data on linear chart. We prepared canvas with function to draw a line. It's only a suggestion.
    You are free to do it any way you want! :)
    * Remember to describe axes and distinguish different stocks on chart!
    * You can add some error handling when error fail.
    * Lastly, make a git patch and send it to recruiter you contacted earlier.

Don't worry if you didn't do everything. Send it in nevertheless!
